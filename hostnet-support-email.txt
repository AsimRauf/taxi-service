Subject: SMTP Configuration Issue - Unable to Send Emails from taxiritje.nl

Dear Hostnet Support Team,

I am experiencing issues with SMTP email configuration for my domain taxiritje.nl and need your assistance to resolve this problem.

**Issue Summary:**
I am unable to send emails through SMTP using my domain email account info@taxiritje.nl. I have tried multiple server configurations but encounter different errors.

**Current Configuration:**
- Email Account: info@taxiritje.nl
- Password: [REMOVED - See .env file]
- Domain: taxiritje.nl

**Servers Tested and Results:**

1. **Using mailout.hostnet.nl:587**
   - Error: Connection timeout (ETIMEDOUT)
   - Configuration: Port 587, STARTTLS, secure: false

2. **Using smtp.hostnet.nl:587**
   - Error: Invalid login: 535 5.7.0 Invalid login or password (EAUTH)
   - Configuration: Port 587, STARTTLS, secure: false

**Technical Details:**
- Application: Node.js web application using nodemailer
- Network: Tested from multiple networks
- Authentication: Using full email address as username with correct password

**Questions:**
1. What is the correct SMTP server hostname I should use for outgoing emails?
2. Are there any specific authentication requirements or settings I'm missing?
3. Could there be any firewall or security restrictions on my account preventing SMTP access?
4. Do I need to enable SMTP access specifically for my email account?

**Request:**
Please provide the correct SMTP configuration settings for my domain, or help identify why the authentication is failing despite using the correct credentials.

I would appreciate your prompt assistance as this is affecting my website's email functionality.

Best regards,
